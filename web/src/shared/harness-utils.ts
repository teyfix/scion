/**
 * Canonical harness identifiers, mirroring `harnesses/<name>/config.yaml`.
 *
 * The `harnesses/` directory in the repository root is the source of truth: each
 * subdirectory contains a `config.yaml` whose `harness:` key is the identifier
 * listed here. When a harness is added to or removed from `harnesses/`, update
 * this list to match.
 *
 * This list is only a *fallback*. At runtime the UI prefers the harness configs
 * returned by `GET /api/v1/harness-configs`; these names are used to populate
 * selects when that call returns nothing (empty result, or a failed request).
 *
 * ORDERING: this is also the order the names render in every fallback select.
 * The first five are the harnesses the UI already offered, kept alphabetical;
 * `antigravity` and `hermes` were appended when they were added. Append new
 * harnesses to the end rather than re-sorting, so that the position of the
 * existing options stays stable for people used to the list. Order carries no
 * meaning beyond display — nothing selects by index, and every select binds its
 * value to component state rather than defaulting to the first option.
