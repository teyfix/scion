title: Multi-Broker Setup
description: Connect multiple machines to a single Scion Hub for distributed agent execution.
---

## Overview

A single Scion Hub can dispatch agents to **multiple Runtime Brokers**. Each broker is a machine — a laptop, cloud VM, or Kubernetes cluster — that runs agent containers. This lets teams pool compute resources and target specific machines for specific workloads.

## Architecture

```
                    ┌──────────┐
       ┌────────────┤ Scion Hub├────────────┐
       │            └────┬─────┘            │
       │                 │                  │
  ┌────▼─────┐    ┌──────▼───┐    ┌────────▼──────┐
  │ Broker A  │    │ Broker B │    │   Broker C    │
  │ (laptop)  │    │(cloud VM)│    │ (K8s cluster) │
  └───────────┘    └──────────┘    └───────────────┘
```

Each broker maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to the Hub. The Hub acts as the control plane; brokers handle container execution locally.

## Adding a Broker

On each machine you want to register:

1. **Install Scion** and configure the Hub endpoint (`scion login`).
2. **Register the broker** with the Hub:
   ```bash
   scion broker register
   ```
3. **Authorize projects** the broker should serve:
   ```bash
   scion broker provide <project>
   ```

Repeat for each machine. See [Runtime Broker](/scion/hosted/ha/runtime-broker/) for detailed setup.

## Broker Selection

When starting an agent, the Hub resolves a broker through a priority cascade:

| Priority | Source | Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Explicit `--broker` flag** | The named broker must be a provider for the project (auto-linked if not). |
| 2 | **Project default broker** | Set in project settings; must be online. |
| 3 | **Hub-level default broker** | Set in [Agent Defaults](/scion/reference/admin-settings/#layout-structure) (`default_runtime_broker`); used when the project has no default. Must be a provider, online, and dispatchable. |
| 4 | **Single-provider auto-select** | If exactly one broker provides the project and it is online, it is used automatically. |
| 5 | **Error** | Multiple eligible brokers require explicit selection; no providers is an error. |

- **Target a specific broker** with the `--broker` flag:
  ```bash
  scion start --broker my-cloud-vm
  ```
- **Check broker availability** across all registered brokers:
  ```bash
  scion broker status
  ```

## IAP-Protected Hubs

When the Hub is behind [Google IAP](/scion/hosted/ha/auth-proxy-iap/), **all** brokers connecting to it need transport auth configured. Each broker must carry an OIDC token to traverse the platform guard.

In a multi-hub setup using the broker's multistore, each hub connection can have its own transport settings:

- **`transportMode`** and **`transportAudience`** are per-connection fields in the credentials file. Different hubs may use different IAP OAuth client IDs.
- A single broker can serve both IAP-protected and plain (non-IAP) hubs simultaneously — connections without transport fields behave as before.
- Environment variables (`SCION_TRANSPORT_MODE`, `SCION_TRANSPORT_AUDIENCE`) apply globally and override all credential-file values. Use per-connection fields when serving hubs with different audiences.

See [Brokers behind IAP](/scion/hosted/ha/auth-proxy-iap/#brokers-behind-iap) for the full deployment guide.

## Considerations

- Each broker manages its own **port pools, container images, and local storage**. Images must be available on each broker independently.
- **Shared directories** (mounted volumes) only work within a single broker — agents on different brokers cannot share a local directory.
- **Workspace strategy** may differ per broker: local brokers typically use git worktrees (`.scion_worktrees/`), while hub-hosted git projects use a single workspace checkout.
- Broker capacity is determined by the machine's resources. The Hub does not enforce cross-broker resource limits.
