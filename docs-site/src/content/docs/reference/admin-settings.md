---

This document describes how Scion manages operational settings when running with a postgres database, including the configuration precedence model, the seeded/managed lifecycle, and the admin settings UI.

## Configuration Precedence

Scion resolves configuration values using a layered merge:

```
coded defaults → SCION_SEED_* → settings.yaml → SCION_SERVER_*
```

Each layer overrides the one before it. The final merged result is the **bootstrap configuration** — the starting point for a hub instance.

### Layer-0 vs Layer-1 Keys

Settings are classified into two layers:

| Layer | Examples | Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Layer-0** (bootstrap) | `server.mode`, `server.database.*`, `server.storage.*`, `server.secrets.*`, `server.hub.port`, `server.auth.dev_mode` | Always resolved from bootstrap configuration. Cannot be changed via the admin UI in database mode. |
| **Layer-1** (operational) | `server.hub.admin_emails`, `server.auth.user_access_mode`, `telemetry.*`, `agent_defaults.*`, `server.github_app.*`, `server.notification_channels`, `server.federation.*`, `runtimes`, `profiles`, `harness_configs` | In database mode, stored in the database and editable via the admin UI. Bootstrap values serve as initial defaults. |

### Database Mode

In database (postgres) mode, Layer-1 settings follow this resolution:

```
Database value > Bootstrap merge (for Layer-1 keys)
Bootstrap only (for Layer-0 keys)
```

The database always wins for Layer-1 keys. Bootstrap values are used as initial seeds and as fallback when no database row exists.

### File Mode

In file mode (sqlite / no postgres), all settings come from the bootstrap merge. The admin UI writes directly to `settings.yaml`.

## Seeded/Managed Lifecycle

Each settings section in the database has an **origin** that tracks whether it was populated by the system or edited by an admin.

### Seeded Sections

When a hub first boots with a postgres database, it populates the settings database from the bootstrap configuration. These sections are marked as **seeded** — they track the deployment configuration.

Seeded sections:
- Re-sync from bootstrap on every hub restart (if the deployment config changes, the database updates)
- Show a caption in the admin UI: *"Tracking deployment configuration — will re-sync on restart until edited"*
- Skip writes when the bootstrap value hasn't changed (no unnecessary revision bumps)

### Managed Sections

When an admin edits a setting in the UI and saves, the section becomes **managed**. Managed sections:
- Are owned by the database — bootstrap changes no longer overwrite them
- Show standard metadata in the admin UI (source, revision, last updated by/at)
- Display superseded notices when the deployment config differs from the database value

### Reset to Bootstrap

A managed section can be reset to tracking mode via the "Reset to bootstrap" button in the admin UI. This:
1. Deletes the database row for that section
2. The section falls back to bootstrap values
3. On next boot, the section is re-seeded from current deployment config

:::note[Known Limitation]
The "Reset to bootstrap" feature requires a backend endpoint that is not yet available. The UI is wired and ready — the endpoint will be added in a follow-up release.
:::

## Environment Variable Namespaces

:::tip[Boolean Environments]
Operational boolean settings configured via environment variables (such as `SCION_SEED_*` and `SCION_SERVER_*`) are processed using the standard `parseBoolEnv` logic. They support case-insensitive spellings for `yes`/`y`/`on` and `no`/`n`/`off`, and issue startup warnings on unrecognized non-empty inputs to help administrators catch configuration typos.
:::

### `SCION_SEED_*` (New)

Use `SCION_SEED_*` to provide initial/default values for operational settings. Seeds are overridable — admins can change them in the UI, and the database value takes precedence.

Seeds re-sync on restart for sections that haven't been admin-edited (seeded sections). Once a section is managed, the seed value is superseded.

**Mapping rules:**
- `server.*` keys: `SCION_SEED_SERVER_` + uppercase snake_case suffix
- Non-`server.*` keys: `SCION_SEED_` + uppercase snake_case suffix

| Setting | Seed Environment Variable |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `server.hub.admin_emails` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_ADMINEMAILS` |
| `server.hub.public_url` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_PUBLICURL` |
| `server.auth.user_access_mode` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_AUTH_USERACCESSMODE` |
| `server.auth.authorized_domains` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_AUTH_AUTHORIZEDDOMAINS` |
| `server.hub.auto_suspend_stalled` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_AUTOSUSPENDSTALLED` |
| `server.hub.soft_delete_retain_files` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_SOFTDELETERETAINFILES` |
| `server.hub.image_registry` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_IMAGEREGISTRY` |
| `telemetry.enabled` | `SCION_SEED_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` |
| `server.github_app.webhooks_enabled` | `SCION_SEED_SERVER_GITHUBAPP_WEBHOOKSENABLED` |

### `SCION_SERVER_*` (Existing)

`SCION_SERVER_*` remains the authoritative namespace for **Layer-0** (bootstrap) settings:

| Setting | Environment Variable |
|---------|---------------------|
| `server.hub.port` | `SCION_SERVER_HUB_PORT` |
| `server.hub.host` | `SCION_SERVER_HUB_HOST` |
| `server.database.driver` | `SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_DRIVER` |
| `server.database.url` | `SCION_SERVER_DATABASE_URL` |
| `server.auth.dev_mode` | `SCION_SERVER_AUTH_DEVMODE` |
| `server.secrets.backend` | `SCION_SERVER_SECRETS_BACKEND` |
| `server.mode` | `SCION_SERVER_MODE` |
| `server.log_level` | `SCION_SERVER_LOGLEVEL` |

### `SCION_SERVER_*` Deprecation for Layer-1

:::caution[Deprecation]
Using `SCION_SERVER_*` for Layer-1 operational settings is **deprecated**. These variables still work during the transition period (they are treated as the top of the bootstrap merge), but a warning is logged on startup.

**Migration:** Replace `SCION_SERVER_<KEY>` with `SCION_SEED_<KEY>` for any Layer-1 setting.

Example:
```diff
- SCION_SERVER_HUB_ADMINEMAILS=admin@example.com
+ SCION_SEED_SERVER_HUB_ADMINEMAILS=admin@example.com
```
:::

The deprecation notice also appears in the admin UI when deprecated variables are detected.

## Maintenance Mode

### Break-Glass Removal

`SCION_SERVER_ADMIN_MODE` no longer forces maintenance mode on a per-node basis. In previous versions, setting this environment variable would override the database maintenance state on that specific node, creating inconsistency in HA deployments.

Maintenance mode is now **cluster-consistent**:
- Set via the admin API (`PUT /api/v1/admin/maintenance`)
- Propagated to all replicas via the event system
- Survives restarts (persisted in the database)
- Cannot be overridden by per-node environment variables

## HA Bootstrap Guidance

For high-availability deployments with multiple hub replicas:

1. **Initial setup:** Use `SCION_SEED_*` environment variables to configure operational settings across all replicas. All replicas share the same bootstrap configuration.

2. **After first admin edit:** Once an admin edits a setting in the UI, the section becomes managed. The database value propagates to all replicas within ~2 seconds via the event system. No per-node env configuration is needed.

3. **Updating seeds:** To change the default for a seeded (unedited) section, update the `SCION_SEED_*` variable and restart the replicas. The new value syncs to the database on boot.

4. **Managed sections:** For sections that have been admin-edited, changing the `SCION_SEED_*` variable has no effect — the database value wins. A "superseded" notice in the admin UI shows which deployment values differ from the database.

5. **Resetting:** To return a managed section to tracking mode, use "Reset to bootstrap" in the admin UI. The section reverts to the seed value and will track future seed changes.

## Admin UI

The admin settings page (`/admin/server-config`) is layer-aware, permission-gated, and has been restructured for improved usability:

- **Permission-Gated Tabs:** Settings page tabs are dynamically gated by the caller's actual resource-level permissions. For example, a role with template-only permissions (like `template.*`) sees only the **Templates** tab, with other administrative tabs hidden. Nav and route guards use granular, per-item permission checks driven by the `/api/v1/admin/status` permissions array.
- **Database mode:** Layer-0 fields are read-only with a "Managed via deployment configuration" badge. Layer-1 fields are editable.
- **File mode:** Fields pinned by `SCION_SERVER_*` environment variables are read-only with a "Set via environment variable" badge. Other fields are editable and write to `settings.yaml`.

### Layout Structure

To streamline management of complex environments, the **General** settings tab is restructured into three high-density, focused cards:

1. **General Card**: Houses central Hub identity, registration endpoints, and core server configurations.
2. **Agent Defaults Card** (with dedicated sub-tabs):
   - Configures default resource constraints (`max_turns`, `max_duration`, limits). These fields can be cleared to blank in the UI, which persists them as `null` in the Hub settings database instead of preserving their previous values, allowing administrators to remove default constraints entirely.
   - Introduces **Default Model** (`default_model`), **Default Thinking Level** (`default_thinking_level`), and **Default Agent Role** (`default_agent_role`) fields directly into the agent default pipeline (with the default agent role updated from `baseline` to `full` for usability).
   - Introduces **Default Runtime Broker** (`default_runtime_broker`), a hub-level default that participates in the [broker resolution cascade](/scion/hosted/ha/multi-broker/#broker-selection). When a project has no default broker and no broker is explicitly requested, the hub-level default is used if the broker is online and dispatchable.
   - Houses the **Telemetry Toggle**, which has been moved to this card to keep telemetry configuration closely aligned with operational defaults.
3. **Project Default Settings Card**: Configures platform-level default annotations and behaviors for newly created projects.

### Runtimes & Profiles Tab

To support complete infrastructure configuration directly from the Web Dashboard, the admin page features a dedicated **Runtimes & Profiles** tab. This tab provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) editors for core execution settings:

- **Runtimes Editor**: Type-aware input fields tailored to specific runtime types:
  - **Docker & Podman**: Fields for daemon sockets, host networks, and storage paths.
  - **Kubernetes (GKE)**: Fields for cluster endpoints, namespace scoping, service account bindings, and PVC volumes.
  - **Cloud Run**: Fields for service endpoints, memory limits, and CPU allocation.
- **Profiles Editor**: Configures resource constraints (limits), target container image registries, and specific template overrides. Supports a native Runtime Profile Selector when launching or configuring agents.
- **Harness Configs Editor**: Features a rich JSON textarea for writing and editing raw harness properties directly, making it easy to tune model parameters or customize env environments.

In highly available (HA) Postgres deployments, all configurations edited through this tab are stored in the database's `hub_settings` table as whole-map JSONB documents. This ensures edits propagate immediately to all replicas, support optimistic locking (CAS), and are never silently dropped or ignored on server PUT actions.

Furthermore, these database-backed settings are wired directly into the runtime broker consumption path. During agent dispatch, both the Scion Hub and the Runtime Broker resolve runtime execution environments and resource profiles dynamically from these persisted database settings. This eliminates the need to distribute or maintain on-disk configuration files (such as local `settings.yaml` files) on individual broker nodes, ensuring a centralized, real-time control plane.

#### Navigation Updates

- **Message Broker Integration**: The Message Broker configuration has been consolidated and moved from the General tab to the **Hub Server** tab, grouping external integrations and network-bound transports in one logical place.
